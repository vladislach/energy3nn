# Predictive Modeling of Small Molecule Binding Affinity through a NequIP-based Equivariant Neural Network (6.S966 Final Project)

A NequIP-based neural network for binding affinity prediction that uses `e3nn irreps` to implement E(3)-equivariant convolutions. The `layers` folder contains the implementation of the equivariant neural network layers.
